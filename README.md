# random_walk
Calculates the location in the Empire State Building by throwing dice 100 times,but we can't go below 0.
Furthermore, to get an idea about how big the chances are of reaching 60 steps, I repeatedly simulate the random walk 10 times and collect the results and visualize it into a histogram.
